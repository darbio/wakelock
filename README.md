**A minimal Wake Lock**

This is a simple static page demonstrating how the [Screen Wake Lock API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen_Wake_Lock_API) works.  
When enabled, the page requests your browser to keep your screen awake — useful for any task where you don’t want your device to go to sleep automatically.

**Key points:**
- ✅ No user data is collected or stored.
- ✅ No analytics or tracking.
- ✅ The code runs entirely in your browser.
- ✅ Open source under the MIT License.

**Live demo:** [https://wakelock.darb.io](https://wakelock.darb.io)

## How it works

Click the **Enable Wake Lock** button to request a screen wake lock.  
When active, your device’s display will not dim or lock automatically while this tab is open.  
You can disable the wake lock anytime.
